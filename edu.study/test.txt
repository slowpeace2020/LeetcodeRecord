 I learned that Roivant is the leading platform for search-powered solutions, and help improve customer and employee search experiences, keep critical applications running smoothly, and protect against cyber threats. I am interested in this position because I love the fact Roivant is an ambitious and driven company. Joining Roivant means joining a mission that matters and doing work I can feel good about. I will have opportunity to work on key projects and initiatives partnering closely with experienced engineers across all Roivant teams. This also means there will always be varied challenges and tasks for me to work on, and I will get to grow and develop in the role. Judging by what I learned about this position, it’s exactly what I’m looking for and what I’m very qualified to do.
