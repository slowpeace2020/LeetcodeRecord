Tech：
Sorting cannot be done in O(n)
Counting sort and radix sort. Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. 
It works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). 
Then do some arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.
Radix sort incorporates the counting sort algorithm so that it can sort larger, 
multi-digit numbers without having to potentially decrease the efficiency 
by increasing the range of keys the algorithm must sort over 
(since this might cause a lot of wasted time).
 
Given one program, one thread can be faster than 2 threads
Yes, Multiple threads work best when they run independently. 
This means that any over utilisation of a shared resource will limit 
or even make using multiple threads slower. For example, the number of CPU, memory, cache

An O(1) algorithm can be further optimized
We assume that any algorithm needs at least a positive constant amount of time for every input. 
Under this assumption, no algorithm can have a subconstant time complexity.

Do 32 bit signed and ‍‌‌‍‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌‍‌unsigned integer represents the same number of values?
An unsigned variable type of int can hold zero and positive numbers, and a signed int holds negative, zero and positive numbers.
In 32-bit integers, an unsigned integer has a range of 0 to 2^32-1 
about 4 billion. 
The signed version goes from -2^31-1 to 2^31, 
about -2 billion to +2 billion. 
The range is the same, but it is shifted on the number line. 


Linear search can be faster than hashtable
No, in a small dataset their difference is small, and in a largedataset, 
the time complexity of lookup in hashtable is O(1), and linear search is O(n)
