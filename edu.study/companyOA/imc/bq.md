How would your friends describe you?
The hardest thing you have ever achieved?
A time you have failed?


Tech：
Sorting cannot be done in O(n)
Given one program, one thread can be faster than 2 threads
An O(1) algorithm can be further optimized
Do 32 bit signed and ‍‌‌‍‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌‍‌unsigned integer represents the same number of values?
Linear search can be faster than hashtable
Describe binary search to non-technical audience, using examples

3 bq+6 tech (hardest, failure, adapt workstyle, explain BST, 1 thread vs 2 threads, quicksort, binary search faster than hashtable look up, improve O(1‍‌‌‍‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‌‍‌‍‌‌‍‌), O(n) faster than O(1))
